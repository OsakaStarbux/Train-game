# Train-game
A game with trains


This is a game I made in Javascript for my 3-year-old with steam trains, tracks, points (track switches) and signals. It was my original idea so it was a hard problem figuring out how to implement it. That got a lot easier when I realised that tracks that branch off are just a tree structure so storing them as trees made more sense.
